Please find enclosed a ClamAV plugin for PKP's OJS. It scans uploaded files for viruses, and if found
refuses to let them upload.

Thanks are due to Hiroaki Kawai for his Clamd PHP plugin (http://openpear.org/package/Net_Clamd).

This plugin resides under a BSD licence.

Obviously without ClamAV's daemon running it will refuse all files :) To configure where the ClamAV
daemon lives, you need to edit the config.inc file using WinSCP or equivalent.

If your Clamd lives on the same machine, it makes sense to specify CLAMDISLOCAL as true such that
Clamd may scan the uploaded file directly. If false, it will be read and sent over the Clamd socket.

If your Clamd lives on the same machine, you almost certainly want to talk to it via its unix socket
which probably is unix:///tmp/clamd.socket. If it lives elsewhere, you'll need to supply an IP and port.
If you're hosted by the PKP, best ask them for where their Clamd is currently living.

Let me know about any bugs via http://www.nedproductions.biz/ or http://www.nedprod.com/.

Enjoy!
